Banking prototyping system (it will run locally and should be fully functional.
 Mainly being developed for university semester project only so no need to
deploy etc or go to some extra level). Each user has two types of accounts
 in it by default: saving and every day account. Every day account can be
used to pay bills (we use term BPAY for it), pay someone (via account
 number or Pay ID). Savings account can only be used to transfer funds 
internally meaning transfer to user's own checking account only. Each 
bill has biller code (of an organization like gas company), reference
number and biller nickname. Transaction has a unique identifier TRX ID.
Customers sign up using email address as unique identifer. Each customer
can have either no pay ID or only one pay ID. If you want to transfer 
someone via pay ID then you just enter its phone number and the system 
 whether they have pay id registered or not. Suppose a customer has bank 
accounts in 3 banking systems. They can have either pay id as null or 
associate it with one of the three accounts. It's a one to one relationship
 between pay ID and customer. There is also chatbot which help users navigate
in the system and help with other banking related questions. Technologies
used will be Express JS, React JS, MySQL and RiveSript(Chatbot)
